Hi! I'm a political tech and data science enthusiast, as well as a fresh Computer Engineering graduate from King's College London. I was born in the US but spent my teenage years in Saudi Arabia before going to the UK for university. My thesis was on how novel ML methodologies can be implemented into electoral polling forecasts (you can find the repo and technical report in [here](https://github.com/KVasq/st-metanet-pres-state-poll)). This, along with a fulfilling history of social volunteerism has gotten me to set my sights on a career that joins data and political action. 

This blog is mainly a place to archive and display my journey in learning R while (at least attempting) to enhance my research of policies and political issues with statistical analysis. I'm mainly inspired by [Noahpinion](https://noahpinion.substack.com), [Nate Cohn](https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn), and [Nate Silver](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538) so if it seems like I'm taking some of their ideas, that's because I probably am.
